- 👋 Hi, I’m @edinam-cita
- 👀 I’m interested in materials science and engineering, and programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the frontend aspect of web development, aspiring to become a full fledged full-stack programmer in the nearest future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with mentors who can help me advance in my endeavor to become a programmer. Other learners can also reach out so we kind of have comradie..I guess:)
- 📫 How to reach me : Feel free to submit a pull request if you'd like to collaborate, or even mentor or be a mentee.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Life can be actually fun (I know, it sounds so matter-of-fact, but I know someone needs to hear this, at least I know I do :) )
